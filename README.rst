Introduction
============

`WebLab-Deusto <http://weblab.deusto.es>`_ is a remote laboratory management
framework developed in the `University of Deusto <http://www.deusto.es>`_. A
remote laboratory is a software and hardware solution that enables students to
access equipment which is physically located in a university, secondary school
or research centre.  There are many types of remote laboratories (for physics,
chemistry, electronics...). What WebLab-Deusto does is:

#. provide a set of APIs to develop new remote laboratories.
#. maintain remote laboratories developed on top of WebLab-Deusto: manage users,
   permissions, user tracking, scheduling, etc.
#. share remote laboratories developed on top of WebLab-Deusto: let other
   universities or secondary schools use your laboratories.
#. use remote laboratories provided by other universities (such as the
   University of Deusto).
