This library can be used to easily implement new experiments using the C++
programming language.

Currently the library has been tested on Windows using Cygwin.

Nonetheless, the library should compile on any standard C++ compiler, as long as
the libraries it depends on are available (mainly xmlrpc-c, see below).


*** USING THE LIBRARY ON WINDOWS WITH CYGWIN ***

New experiments can be based on the dummy_experiment_server.cpp example.

This experiment simply links to the library and declares a class which inherits
from the abstract ExperimentServer, overriding the following events:

	virtual std::string onStartExperiment() = 0;
	virtual std::string onSendFile(std::string const & encoded_file, std::string const & fileinfo) = 0;
	virtual std::string onSendCommand(std::string const & command) = 0;
	virtual std::string onDispose() = 0;
	
Once an instance of the new class has been created and launched (through the
launch member function), the server will listen for connections and the virtual
member functions above will be automatically called as requests are received.


*** COMPILING & DEPENDENCIES ***

This library depends on the xmlrpc-c library. Though theorethically you should
be able to use any version of it, older versions may lead to some trouble.


*** KNOWN BUGS ***

Seems to crash under certain situations, especially if there are a high number
of simultaneous connections to the server.



*** STEP BY STEP GUIDE FOR CYGWIN ***

1) Get the xmlrpc-c library and place it somewhere.

2) Open cygwin. Previously, make sure that all necessary tools are installed. This includes GNU make and the g++ compiler.

3) Go to the xmlrpc-c folder and make and install it in the usual way:
	./configure
	make
	make install
	
4) Ensure that your LD_LIBRARY_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH environment variables are set properly. Particularly, they should point to /usr/local/lib, 
   where the xmlrpc-c binaries will be placed. This will make it possible to link xmlrpc through the standard "g++ -lxmlrpc ..."
   
5) Build your experiment server, using the DummyExperimentServer as base.

6) Use the provided makefile to build your experiment server, using:
	make all
	
7) You will need cygwin1.dll to run the .exe.
