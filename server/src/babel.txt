# First, update the messages.pot file:
pybabel extract -F babel.cfg -k lazy_gettext -o messages.pot --project flaskclient .

# Then, if you want to generate for a certain language (es for Spanish in this case), run:
pybabel update -i messages.pot -d flaskclient/translations -l es

# If it was the first time, run:
pybabel init -i messages.pot -d flaskclient/translations -l es

# This will generate a file called flaskclient/translations/es/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po with those messages.
# Once that is translated, run the following to compile it:
pybabel compile -f -d flaskclient/translations
